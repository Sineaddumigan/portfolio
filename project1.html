                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The Multiplication tables check (MTC) is a compulsory online assessment that is used to check primary 4 pupil’s ability to recall the times tables up to 12 x 12.</p> 
                <p>The idea was first put forward in a Conservative manifesto. The purpose is to improve the numeracy skills of pupils in the UK to aid their fluency in mathematics by helping teachers identify pupils who have not yet mastered this important mathematical skill so schools can give them additional support.</p>
                <p>The Multiplication tables check works by displaying each question for an amount of time that allows for recall and not calculation.</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>Understanding the technical landscape, the quality of connectivity that schools have and the situation of their ICT.</p>
                <p>Creating a service that adds as little burden as possible to schools, creating a service that is flexible enough to fit into schools’ busy schedules. Providing great UX so that teachers can complete tasks quickly and with ease.</p>
                <p>Basing designs on the GOV.UK Design System but adding content and graphics to adapt it so that it is appropriate for children.</p>
                <p>Creating an assessment that is accessible for as many children as possible designing colour contrast, font configurations, in-built screen readers etc,  so disabled pupils can independently take the check.</p>

            <h2>What the team did</h2>
            <p>The team worked in Agile and engaged with the STA, test devleopers and schools across the UK to create a brand new service. There are 4 parts to the service:</p>
            <ul class="light-grey-body">
                <li>Service manager to manage check windows, upload pupil data, edit time for questions in the check, manage settings for schools in different time zones</li>
                <li>Test developers to upload and view forms, assign forms to check windows and download pupil check data</li>
                <li>Schools administration to register pupils, group pupils, attendance, access arrangements, mock area, generate passwords and PINs, restarts, Headteacher declaration form and see results
                </li>
                <li>Pupils to take the ‘check’. Designing for a range of devices and a range of access arrangements.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>Research was done to understand the different types of schools that exist across the UK, their digital capacities and any issues a digital assessment would impose on them. We tested and iterated designs and prototypes to help build out understanding of how best to meet the users’ needs.</p>

            <h2>An inclusive service</h2>
            <p>We tested the MTC with a range of user on a range of devices to ensure the service was as inclusive as possible.</p>
            <p>The devices we design for and tested with were mobile phones, tablets, latptops and desktops.</p>
            <p>We considered pupils with visual impairments, processing needs, physical disabilities, poor IT skills, pupils on the austistic spectrum, cognitive needs (e.g. dyslexia and dyscalculia) and English as an additional language.</p>
